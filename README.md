# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

In this repository I have launched a page containing a mini quiz.  The quiz generates elements and performs functions listed:

 *   a start button that activates a timer
 *   presents the user with questions and answers to select
 *   records the score in local memory
 *   displays the score and players name
